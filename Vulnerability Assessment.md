# Vulnerability Assessments
A Vulnerability Assessment aims to identify and categorize risks for security weaknesses related to assets within an environment. It is important to note that there is little to no manual exploitation during a vulnerability assessment. A vulnerability assessment also provides remediation steps to fix the issues.

Risk: something bad that could happen
Threat: something bad that is happening
Vulnerabilities: weaknesses that could lead to a threat

### Asset Management 
When an organization of any kind, in any industry, and of any size needs to plan their cybersecurity strategy, they should start by creating an inventory of their data assets. These assets that need to known and be protected.Asset inventory is a critical component of vulnerability management. An organization needs to understand what assets are in its network to provide the proper protection and set up appropriate defenses. 

These assets could be 
1) All data stored on-premises.
2) All of the data storage that their cloud provider possesses.
3) All data stored within various Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. (online services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft Teams, Apple iCloud, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office 365, Google Docs)
4) All of the applications a company needs to use to conduct their usual operation and business.
5) All of a company's on-premises computer networking devices. (Hubs,switches,etc)

# Assessment Standards
Both penetration tests and vulnerability assessments should comply with specific standards to be accredited and accepted by governments and legal authorities.

### Compliance Standards

1. **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**  
   - **Focus**: Protects credit card data.  
   - **Key Requirement**: Organizations handling cardholder data must secure it in a segmented environment (CDE) separate from regular systems.  
   - **Example**: An online store like Amazon must secure credit card processing systems from the rest of its network.

2. **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**  
   - **Focus**: Protects patients' medical data.  
   - **Key Requirement**: Requires risk assessments and vulnerability identification to secure sensitive health information.  
   - **Example**: Hospitals must regularly assess their systems to protect patient records.

3. **FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act)**  
   - **Focus**: Secures government systems and data.  
   - **Key Requirement**: Mandates a vulnerability management program to maintain system confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  
   - **Example**: A government agency must prove that its systems are regularly checked for security issues.

4. **ISO 27001 (Information Security Standard)**  
   - **Focus**: Global standard for managing information security.  
   - **Key Requirement**: Requires internal and external scans at least quarterly and maintains an Information Security Management System.  
   - **Example**: A tech company performs quarterly security scans to stay ISO 27001 certified.

These standards help protect sensitive data and ensure organizations are meeting security best practices.
### Penetration Testing Standards
Penetration tests should not be performed without any rules or guidelines. The owner of a network must have a signed legal contract with pentesters outlining what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.

__Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)__ can be applied to all types of tests. These are the sections in the PTES: Pre-engagement Interactions,Intelligence,Gathering,Threat Modeling,Vulnerability Analysis,Exploitation,Post Exploitation,Reporting.

__OSSTMM is the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual__, another set of guidelines pentesters can use to ensure they're doing their jobs properly. OSSTMM is divided into five different channels Human Security (human beings are subject to social engineering exploits) ,Physical Security, Wireless Communications (including but not limited to technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth), Telecommunications, Data Networks.

__The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)__ is well known for their NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a system for designing incident response policies and procedures. The phases are Planning, Discovery, Attack, Reporting.

__OWASP__ stands for the Open Web Application Security Project. They're typically the go-to organization for defining testing standards and classifying risks to web applications.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

**CVSS** is an industry-standard used to score vulnerabilities, helping prioritize risks based on exploitability and impact. It is often paired with Microsoft's **DREAD** model, which assesses risks using five factors:

- **Damage Potential**
- **Reproducibility**
- **Exploitability**
- **Affected Users**
- **Discoverability**

---

### CVSS Components:

1. **Exploitability Metrics**
   - **Attack Vector**: How the attack is delivered (e.g., network, physical).
   - **Attack Complexity**: How hard it is to exploit the issue.
   - **Privileges Required**: User privileges needed for the exploit.
   - **User Interaction**: Whether user action is needed to exploit.

2. **Impact Metrics**
   - Based on the **CIA Triad**:
     - **Confidentiality**: Protecting sensitive info (e.g., passwords).
     - **Integrity**: Ensuring info remains unaltered

# Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
### Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) – Simplified

**OVAL** is an international standard used to assess and report the security status of a system. It helps security teams understand system configurations, vulnerabilities, and issues without needing to exploit them. It's widely used by the U.S. government (DHS, NIST) and security tools like Nessus to automate vulnerability management and ensure systems are compliant with policies.

#### OVAL Process:
- **Identify** system configurations for testing.
- **Evaluate** the system’s current state (e.g., vulnerable, patched).
- **Report** the findings.

#### OVAL Definitions:
- **Vulnerability Definitions**: Check for system vulnerabilities.
- **Compliance Definitions**: Ensure systems follow required policies.
- **Inventory Definitions**: Check if certain software is installed.
- **Patch Definitions**: Verify if a system has the right security patches.

#### OVAL ID Format:
- Example: `oval:org.mitre.oval:obj:1116`

### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) – Simplified

**CVE** is a public catalog of known security issues. Each vulnerability is given a unique **CVE ID**, allowing organizations to track, manage, and fix them. The **CVE program** is managed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ensures that vulnerabilities are standardized across different platforms and tools.

#### Stages of Getting a CVE ID:
1. **Identify** if an issue qualifies as a vulnerability.
2. **Contact** the affected product’s vendor.
3. If the vendor is a **CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)**, they can assign a CVE ID.
4. If not, submit a request through the **CVE web form**.
5. After submission, receive a **confirmation email**.
6. If approved, receive the **CVE ID**.
7. The CVE ID becomes **public** after notifying vendors and affected parties.
8. **Announce** the CVE to the public.
9. Provide additional information for the CVE database.
