# Enumeration Principles

| No. | Principle                                                   |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view. |
| 2   | Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.     |
| 3   | There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target. |

# Enumeration Methadology

| Layer               | Description                                                                 | Information Categories                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Internet Presence| Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure.| Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures |
| 2. Gateway          | Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure. | Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare     |
| 3. Accessible Services | Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally. | Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface                  |
| 4. Processes        | Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services. | PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination                                       |
| 5. Privileges       | Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services. | Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment                                 |
| 6. OS Setup         | Identification of the internal components and systems setup.                | OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files list |

Layer 1 - We find find targets to investigate
Layer 2 - This is what protecting the targets and its interface.
Layer 3 - This is the services the targets offer.
Layer 4 - The processes that are launched by the system. The data exchanged between the processes.
Layer 5 - Each service or process is run with certain priveledges. The priveledges used need to be understood.
Layer 6 - Understanding the host itself the Enviornment. Understanding how the admins maintain the system.

# Domain Enumeration

First point of investigation is the main website. Examine the SSL Certificate of the website usually includes subdomain as well. https://crt.sh/ This source is Certificate Transparency logs. Certificate Transparency is a process that is intended to enable the verification of issued digital certificates for encrypted Internet connections. 
 
### Crt.sh Certificate Transperancy
```
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq .
```
### Crt.sh Unique subdomains 
```
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u
```
### Crt.sh identify hosts
```
for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done
```
### Shodan

Shodan can be used to find devices that are connected permenantley to the internet like IOT devices. It searches the internet for open ports and other filters based on the IPs provided (FTP, SSH, SNMP, Telnet, RTSP, or SI).

```
for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f4 >> ip-addresses.txt;done
for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done
```
### Dig

Displays dns records related to the domain 
```
dig any inlanefreight.com
```
| Record Type | Description                                                                                                                      |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A records   | We recognize the IP addresses that point to a specific (sub)domain through the A record. Here we only see one that we already know. |
| MX records  | The mail server records show us which mail server is responsible for managing the emails for the company. Since this is handled by Google in our case, we should note this and skip it for now. |
| NS records  | These kinds of records show which name servers are used to resolve the FQDN to IP addresses. Most hosting providers use their own name servers, making it easier to identify the hosting provider. |
| TXT records | This type of record often contains verification keys for different third-party providers and other security aspects of DNS, such as SPF, DMARC, and DKIM, which are responsible for verifying and confirming the origin of the emails sent. Here we can already see some valuable information if we look closer at the results. |

# Cloud Resources Passsive Enumeration

The use of cloud resources is prevelant in many companies like S3 buckets (AWS), blobs (Azure), cloud storage (GCP), which can be accessed if configured incorrectly.

##  Enumerate Company Hosted Servers
```
for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22f50da7-5dea-493a-997f-b2757e7f7120)

In the above image we can see s3 bucket We can find cloud resources through Google Dorking as well.

### Google Dork AWS
```
intext:CompanyName inurl:amazonaws.com
```
### Google Dork Azure
```
intext:CompanyName inurl:blob.core.windows.net
```
## Passive Enumeration

### domain.glass

Third party providers such as [domain.glass](https://domain.glass/) can give information on the company infrastructure. It can also give cloudflare assessment 'Safe' which means there is a security measure (level 2 in the methadology).

### GrayHatWarfare

[GrayHatWarfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/)This can be used to different cloud storage resources alternative to google dorking method above. Can even sort and filter by file format.

Companies can make mistakes, private ssh keys can be uploaded which can give us a way to access machines.

### Employee Enumeration (staff)

Use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) or [Xing](https://www.xing.com/) to find employees in the organisation. The experience section usually shows which methadologies or frameworks they use. Job postings from the company can also give us information on the frameworks and capabilities of a an employee.

[Github](https://github.com/boomcamp/django-security) can be used to find repositories of the employee. Which could have misconfigurations eg. Django OWASP10. Sometimes employees can have hardcoded security keys(JWT Token), Personal email addresses etc in the code which can be used.

# FTP Enumeration

FTP Runs on application layer of TCP/IP protocol. In FTP 2 connection channels are opened Control channel (port21) and Data channel (port 20).

__Active FTP Mode__:
1) In active mode, the client initiates the connection.
2) The client sends a PORT command to the server, specifying a client-side port for data transfer.
3) The server then connects back to the client on that specified port.
However, if the client is behind a firewall, the serverâ€™s connection attempt may be blocked.

__Passive FTP Mode__:
1)In passive mode, the server announces a port for data transfer.
2 The client sends a PASV command to the server, requesting a port.
3) The server responds with a random port number for the client to use.
4) The client initiates the data connection to that port, bypassing firewall issues.

### TFTP
TFTP does use user authentication. Runs on UDP based application layer recovery. TFTP operating exclusively in directories and with files that have been shared with all users and can be read and written globally (can be read based on read and write permissions).

## Default configuration on FTP

Configuration can be found in /etc/vsftpd.conf for vsFTPd.

 /etc/ftpusers holds the users that are denied access to FTP even if the users exist.

 ## Dangerous Settings

 Anonymous authentication This is often used to allow everyone on the internal network to share files and data without accessing each other's computers.
 | Setting                    | Description                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| anonymous_enable           | Allowing anonymous login?                                                                      |
| anon_upload_enable         | Allowing anonymous to upload files?                                                             |
| anon_mkdir_write_enable    | Allowing anonymous to create new directories?                                                    |
| no_anon_password           | Do not ask anonymous for password?                                                               |
| anon_root                  | Directory for anonymous.                                                                       |
| write_enable               | Allow the usage of FTP commands: STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE, and SITE?              |

Once connected through anonymous usually we get STATUS:220 with banner of the FTP server. This information could hold the service version. We can download all the files that are available to anonymous login.

### Anonymous Login
```
ftp 10.129.14.136
```
use __ls__ command to list files and status command to get settings of the FTP server. For more information on packet tracing and communication use __debug__ and __trace__ command.

### Hiding IDs and Recursive Listing

| Setting                | Description                                                                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dirmessage_enable      | Show a message when users first enter a new directory?                                         |
| chown_uploads          | Change ownership of anonymously uploaded files?                                                |
| chown_username         | User who is given ownership of anonymously uploaded files.                                      |
| local_enable           | Enable local users to login?                                                                   |
| chroot_local_user      | Place local users into their home directory?                                                    |
| chroot_list_enable     | Use a list of local users that will be placed in their home directory?                            |
| hide_ids               | All user and group information in directory listings will be displayed as "ftp".                |
| ls_recurse_enable      | Allows the use of recursive listings.                                                           |

__hide_ids=YES__ setting will not show UID and GUID. Identification of which rights these files have been written and uploaded will be difficult. This setting is a security feature to prevent local usernames from being revealed. If usernames are found it can help in methods like brute force.  In reality, [fail2ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail2ban) solutions are now a standard implementation of any infrastructure that logs the IP address and blocks all access to the infrastructure after a certain number of failed login attempts.

__ls_recurse_enable=YES__ This is often set on the vsFTPd server to have a better overview of the FTP directory structure.

## Download and Upload FTP files

__Download a perticular file__
```
get Important\ Notes.txt
```
__Download all available files__

```
wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.129.14.136
```
This can alert the system as usually no employee downloads all the files.  wget will create a directory with the name of the IP address of our target. 

use ```tree .``` command to see the directory structure. Use ```put file.txt``` to upload files.

## Footprinting the Service

Use nmap NSE scripts to enumerate FTP. 

Find NSE ftp scripts
```
find / -type f -name ftp* 2>/dev/null | grep scripts
```
As we already know, the FTP server usually runs on the standard TCP port 21, which we can scan using Nmap. We also use the version scan (-sV), aggressive scan (-A), and the default script scan (-sC) against our target.
```
sudo nmap -sV -p21 -sC -A 10.129.14.136
```
1) Default Script Scan in Nmap:
 Nmap uses fingerprints, responses, and standard ports to scan services. 
 For example, the __ftp-anon__ script checks if an FTP server allows anonymous access.
 The __ftp-syst__ script reveals FTP server status and version.
2) Tracing NSE Scripts:
 Use __--script-trace__ in Nmap scans to see commands, ports, and responses.

## Service Interaction

__netcat__ or __telnet__ can be used to interact with the FTP server.

```
nc -nv 10.129.14.136 21
```
```
 telnet 10.129.14.136 21
```
## Openssl ftp connect

If FTP server runs with __TLS/SSL__ encryption. __Openssl__ client can be used to communicated with FTP server.
```
openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.136:21 -starttls ftp
```
The __SSL__ certificate can show us valuable information such  as hostname, email address,etc.
