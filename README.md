# Hackthebox Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)

These are my personal notes for each section on the CPTS path for the examination. There are commands that can be readily copied and used for each section.

## Disclaimer 

Make sure you change IPs in the commands when you copy and use them.
I suggest making notes for yourself when studying. I will also make a markdown file that will be used for the attack chain as well.
