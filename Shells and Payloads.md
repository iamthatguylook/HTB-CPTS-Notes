# Introduction
### Shell Overview for Penetration Testing

A **shell** provides a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the system (e.g., Bash, cmd, PowerShell). For penetration testers, getting a shell often means successfully exploiting a vulnerability to gain remote access and control over a target machine.

### Why Get a Shell?
- **Direct OS Access**: Run system commands, explore the file system, and escalate privileges.
- **Persistence**: Keep access to work longer, transfer files, and exfiltrate data.
- **Low Detection**: Shells are harder to detect than graphical access (e.g., RDP, VNC), and faster for OS navigation and automation.

### Types of Shells:
- **Standard Shells**: Gained by exploiting vulnerabilities (e.g., EternalBlue to access cmd on Windows).
- **Web Shells**: Exploit web vulnerabilities (e.g., file upload) and use a browser to issue commands.

### Payloads Deliver Shells
- **Payload**: Code designed to exploit a system vulnerability, often leading to remote shell access.
